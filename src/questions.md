Quetsions:

PokemonItem page only renders a type when I specify type_1 or type_2




To do:

color cording based on type?
use a classname and try this in css.

move searchbar code into it's own component with handleChange and this.props.handleChange

in render, put a loading spinner

Set up one more test
