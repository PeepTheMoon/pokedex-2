Quetsions:
url search bar -- text entered doesn'y populate search bar

prev and next buttons no longer are working, and they're rendered twice on the page.  Not sure why


To do:
move searchbar code into it's own component with handleChange and this.props.handleChange

in render, put a loading spinner

put pagination at top
