Quetsions:
url search bar -- text entered doesn'y populate search bar

refactored search components.  The search is not getting type, only name.  returns an empy array from fetchedData on type.

prev and next buttons no longer are working


To do:
move searchbar code into it's own component with handleChange and this.props.handleChange

in render, put a loading spinner

put pagination at top (in )
