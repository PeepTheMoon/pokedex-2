PokemonItem page only renders a type when I specify type_1 or type_2

I tried to do my name or type search and it broke!  I modeled it after the attack or defense and I'm not sure what I'm overlooking. Now nothing renders

color cording based on type?

move searchbar code into it's own component with handleChange and this.props.handleChange

in render, put  a loading spinner
