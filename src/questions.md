I need help with filtering my pokemon data by the attack search.

I need help with getting started on sorting my pokemon data with a dropdown menu- forEach?

I'm receiving an error on my details page.  It can't read the pokemon property for some reason, but when I console log the data it shows up, just won't render to the page.
