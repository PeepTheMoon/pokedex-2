Quetsions:

-url search bar -- text entered doesn'y populate search bar

-prev and next buttons no longer are working, and they're rendered twice on the page.  Not sure why


To do:

-in render, put a loading spinner

-put pagination at top 

-disable next button when on last page of results

-update url search params to populate search bar when entered in browser
